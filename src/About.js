        <p className={styles.p}>
          Hi, I'm Tate! I'm a recent computer science graduate from Seattle University and an aspiring software engineer.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.p}>
          I have experience building various geospatial data analysis tools from my time working at <a href="https://terrainworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TerrainWorks</a> and <a href="http://mazamascience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mazama Science</a>. At Mazama Science I helped build R packages for air quality data analysis and visualization, while at TerrainWorks I created machine-learning ArcGIS toolboxes for detecting geospatial features from LiDAR imagery. Although I didn't foresee specializing in GIS, I found both experiences incredibly interesting, instructive, and rewarding given the roles our products played in land-use planning, environmental protection, and public health.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.p}>
          While my professional experience so far has focused on R backends for GIS tools, I've always had a personal interest in frontends and visuals. The university courses I took in web development and SaaS inspired me to start building full-stack web applications in my free timeâ€”my goal being to work towards a full career building web-based tools.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.p}>
          In my remaining free time (when I'm not coding!) you can usually find me reading vintage mystery novels, watching gialli, or listening to 70s poliziotteschi film soundtracks.
