At Mazama Science I helped build R packages for air quality data analysis and visualization, while at TerrainWorks I created machine-learning ArcGIS toolboxes for detecting geospatial features from LiDAR imagery. I found both experiences incredibly interesting, instructive, and rewarding given the roles of our products in land-use planning, environmental protection, and public health.\n        </p>\n\n        <p className={styles.p}>\n          Although my professional experience has been focused on R backends for GIS tools, I've always had a personal interest in frontends and visuals.

While we three \"founders\" have participated in every round, we now usually have a guest who joins in for a few rounds at a time too. We've also started doing \"themed\" rounds where participants are given a prompt to decide what albums to post. Some have been objective like: \"participants must post an artist who shares their star sign\", or entirely subjective like: \"rainy day music\". The majority of rounds so far have been a complete free-for-all—anyone can post anything that hasn't been shared yet. We do try to limit ourselves to albums of reasonable length and number of songs though, and repeat artists are allowed but generally avoided.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Overall, our music club been a fun, low-committment activity that keeps us connected and involves something we all enjoy.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>Problems</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          Unfortunately, I quicky realized that a group chat was not a great place for organizing information. If I wanted to remember my friends' favorite Avril Lavigne songs from her 2002 hit, <em>Let Go</em>, or find out who posted <em>Twin Temple (Bring You Their Signature Sound... Satanic Doo-Wop)</em>, I had to do a lot of scrolling through our multi-year chat history. The text thread format simply wasn't practical for summarizing our dozens of rounds, and on top of that we also migrated to a different messaging app at one point—further fragmenting our already disorganized club history.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Besides the practical shortcomings of our group chat, something else also began to dawn on me: <em>we're generating a lot of data!</em> Every posted album and liked song gave insight into our members' listening habits. We could learn a lot of interesting things about ourselves and the club by studying how we participated. Things like:\n        </p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Which members have the greatest overlap of favorite songs?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Who do <em>I</em> share the most favorite songs with?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Who posts the oldest music? The newest?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Who most consistently votes for the top song of each album?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            What albums were the most divisive? The most unifying?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            What was the shortest round? The longest?\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          If I could get access to music metadata (like through <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/\">Spotify's API</a>), maybe I could answer more complex questions too:\n        </p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            What genre does each member post the most?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Who posts the most danceable music? Instrumental? Sad? Etc.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            What songs will each participant likely vote for? (Could I feed track metadata and a member's past votes into a machine-learning model and have it try to predict their favorites?)\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          By the middle of 2021, I realized there were two things I wanted for our club: 1) a way to easily view information about our past rounds and 2) the ability to gain insights from our listening habits. Feeling invigorated by my <Link to=\"/\">SaaS coursework</Link> and eager for a new side-project, I decided that building a website was the best way to achieve both goals.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>Starting at the Back(end)</h2>\n\n        <h3>Database</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          So where to begin?

Looking back now, in some ways I regret my decision since my data has become increasingly relational and doesn't utilyze all the benefits of document-based stores, but at the same time I am thankful for the flexibility and its allowance for me to experiment with the information I keep track of.\n        </p>\n\n        <img src=\"\" alt=\"MongoDB Atlas Cluster\" />\n\n        <h3>REST API & Web Service</h3>\n\n        <p>\n          After creating my MongoDB Atals Cluster I theoretically could have just used its web interface to populate my database document-by-document, but who wants to do that?! I wanted to input data in a pretty UI with custom forms for each model! I wanted input validation! Dropdown lists! But in order to do any of that, my database had to be managable from outside MongoDB Atlas. I needed an API so that, using REST principles, I could CRUD documents using simple HTTP requests like POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          These requests had to be sent somewhere though—a server, specifically, which would respond to them by carrying out the appropriate actions in the database and any other necessary operations.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          by myself since my goal was not to formalize the Music Club by making it an app everyone had to use. As bad as group chats are for organizing information, they're still pretty good for, well...chatting! I didn't want to change the atmosphere of the club for everyone.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>Admin Interface</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          Now that I had a functional API to CRUD objects in my database, the next step was to actually populate the database with members, rounds, and albums.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>Member Interface</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          The admin app provided just about everything I had first hoped to accomplish: an interface that could display our round history as well as some data insights. Unfortunately, I had to admit it wasn't very pretty to look at. The birds-eye view layout was too busy and tailored more for admin tasks than for a clean read-only experience. I didn't want to make this public and give every visitor the ability to manipulate the database. I could have added authentication so just I could  access to  There was also the issue of authentication, since anyone who could run the app could make any changes they wished. Not that I didn't trust my friends to keep their hands off, but . My remedy to this was to create a second interface—one designed specifically for club <em>members</em> who only want to read data and not write it.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Round thumbnails\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>Future Goals</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          Although I purposefully left out interaction from the member interface (sign-in, creating).......\n          this would require a substantial database rehaul.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ProjectMusicClub;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/time_series.76ee5ef5.png\";","import timeSeriesImg from './time_series.png';\n\nimport styles from '../Project.module.css';\n\nfunction ProjectAirMonitorArchive() {\n  return (\n    <div className={styles.Project}>\n      <h1>Air Monitor Archive</h1>\n\n      <div className={styles.gallery}>\n        <img src={timeSeriesImg} height={480} />\n      </div>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          Our primary client during my time at Mazama Science was the <a href=\"https://www.airfire.org/\">AirFire Research team</a>: one of four such research teams under the U.S. Forest Service's PNW Threat Characterization and Management Program. A large portion of our work for AirFire included developing services to publically communicate historical U.S. air quality data, and for this we built R packages that could generate static images of various plot types. By themselves, these packages were only directly useful to the R developers in the AirFire team, so in order to effectively showcase the insights these plots provided to a larger audience (such as <a href=\"https://www.wildlandfiresmoke.us/air-resource-advisors\">Air Resource Advisors</a>) we also needed an accessible platform for requesting and viewing our visualizations.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>Solution</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          Our solution to this challenge was to create a web frontend that would allow users to request and view different air quality plots. The requests would be sent to a small backend web service that would generate the plot using our R packages and return an image URL for the interface to display.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          My role in this production was to prototype a single-page web application including the basic features users would require: form fields to input plot parameters and a pane for viewing the resulting visualization image. Initially, there were 4 kinds of these visualizations to support:\n        </p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Daily average: a plot displaying the daily mean <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics\">PM2.5</a> reading for a given monitor during a specified time range.</li>\n          <li>Time of Day: a plot displaying the hourly (12am - 11pm) PM2.5 reading for a given monitor during a specified time range.</li>\n          <li>Time-series: a plot displaying the raw PM2.5 readings for a given monitor during a specified time range.</li>\n          <li>Air Quality Index (AQI): A chart describing the various AQI levels used by the EPA to report air quality.</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>\n          Since my task was to create a simple prototype, I was given almost complete freedom in designing the interface as I saw fit. Having a sidebar for input and a large pane for visualizations felt like the most natural page layout for the application, and updating the visualizations upon any form change made requests feel snappy and efficient. The similar requirements of 1) a specific monitor and 2) a specific time range across the first 3 plot types also indicated I could display common form fields for those parameters. For selecting the date range I used the handy <a href=\"https://www.daterangepicker.com/\">daterangepicker</a> widget, but monitor selection was a bit more involved. Given that the plotting functions required a monitor ID, I didn't want to just present the user with a gigantic dropdown list of IDs without a hint to the name or location of the monitor they represented. Instead, I chose to embed a small <a href=\"https://leafletjs.com/\">Leaflet</a> map populated with icons representing all the monitors available across the United States. Selecting an icon on a map proved much more intuitive than typing or selecting an ID! Finally, the plot type could be chosen using a selection of radio buttons. Other services, like generating/downloading report documents or raw reading CSVs, were added as clickable links when they became available.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>Reflection</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          Overall, I was very happy with the final result of my prototype. The user interface was the last link connecting a larger, non-coder audience with our services, and my frontend provided all the basic functionality for our clients to start gaining insights from the air quality data provided by the EPA. However, I think there was a lot of room for improvement technology-wise. Since my boss wanted to quickly and easily share my prototype with members of the AirFire team, I was requested to write the entire app (HTML, CS, JS) in a single .html file. This didn't present too much of an issue since the app was small and I was able to keep my code concise, but it certainly isn't a practice I'd like to continue. Given its small size, I was also requested not to use a frontend framework or library and write all page behavior using vanilla JavaScript and JQuery, which in age of React, Angular, and Vue, felt antiquated and less organized.\n        </p>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ProjectAirMonitorArchive;\n","import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\nimport styles from './App.module.css';\n\nimport { HashRouter, Route, Routes } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nimport About from './About';\nimport NavBar from './NavBar';\nimport Projects from './Projects';\nimport ProjectMusicClub from './ProjectMusicClub';\nimport ProjectAirMonitorArchive from './ProjectAirMonitorArchive/ProjectAirMonitorArchive';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <HashRouter>\n      <div className={styles.App}>\n        <NavBar />\n\n        <div className=\"container-sm p-4\">\n          <Routes>\n            <Route exact path=\"/\" element={<About />} />\n            <Route exact path=\"/projects\" element={<Projects />} />\n            <Route exact path=\"/music-club\" element={<ProjectMusicClub />} />\n            <Route exact path=\"/projects/air-monitor-archive\" element={<ProjectAirMonitorArchive />} />\n          </Routes>\n        </div>\n\n        <footer className=\"footer p-4\">\n          <div className={styles.linksList}>\n            <a href=\"mailto:tatebrasel@gmail.com\"><i className=\"fas fa-envelope\"></i> Email</a>\n            <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tate-brasel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-linkedin\"></i> Linkedin</a>\n            <a href=\"https://github.com/tabrasel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i className=\"fab fa-github\"></i> GitHub</a>\n          </div>\n        </footer>\n      </div>\n    </HashRouter>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
